# E-Commerce Product Recommendation Model

## 📌 Overview
This project implements an **AI-powered product recommendation system** for E-commerce platforms using **Collaborative Filtering** and **Content-Based Filtering**.

## 🚀 Features
- Recommends products based on user preferences & behavior
- Uses **Machine Learning models** like **Matrix Factorization** (SVD, KNN, etc.)
- Supports **User-Based** & **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering**
- Scalable for large datasets

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn
- Flask (for API deployment)
- Jupyter Notebook (for experimentation)

## 📂 Project Structure



## 🔥 Setup & Installation
